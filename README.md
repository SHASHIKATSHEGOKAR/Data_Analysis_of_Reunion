## Data Modeling

In the Data Modeling section of the assignment, we focus on designing a database schema to store and manage data efficiently. We define entities, attributes, primary and foreign keys, and establish relationships between tables. The ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) for our database is provided in the `data_modeling/` directory.

**Instructions:**
- Review the ERD to understand the database schema.
- Implement the database schema in your preferred DBMS (Database Management System).

## SQL Queries

The SQL Queries section involves writing SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data from the database. We use the schema designed in the Data Modeling section to perform various data analysis tasks.

**Instructions:**
- Find the SQL queries for each task in the `sql_queries/` directory.
- Execute the queries against your database and provide the results.

## ETL Process

The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process involves data extraction from various sources, transformation of data, and loading it into the target database. In this section, we outline the ETL process and provide scripts for data extraction and transformation.

**Instructions:**
- Review the ETL scripts in the `etl_process/` directory.
- Follow the instructions within each script to perform ETL.

## Time Series Analysis

In the Time Series Analysis section, we analyze time-based data, perform trend analysis, and generate insights from time series data.

**Instructions:**
- Refer to the `time_series_analysis/` directory for scripts and data related to time series analysis.
- Execute the scripts to perform time series analysis.

## Conclusion

This assignment covers fundamental concepts and practices in Data Engineering, including data modeling, SQL querying, ETL processes, and time series analysis. It provides an opportunity to apply these concepts to real-world scenarios and gain hands-on experience in data engineering tasks.
